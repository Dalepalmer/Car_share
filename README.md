Car Share is a Rails app that helps track vehicle usage within a household or share group. The idea is a single owner vehicle lies dormant most of the time, so it's much better economically for it to be owned collectively. This app aims to provide a reliable way of documenting mileage and time use so that gas and maintenance are shared according to use.
